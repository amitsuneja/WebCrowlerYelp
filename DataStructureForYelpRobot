The friendly staff asks your name and remembers it! Thank you Caesar. Beth herself also happened to be there mostly visiting with each customer in between helping as server, cashier, bartender etc.... \xa0so impressed we're going back tonight for the Live music. Oh, i forgot to mention the Burgers are Crazy Good! Nice place and wish them much success"],

                    'Mannnnnn it was a long night and UberEats made it even longer. The family and I wanted to get something from Applebee\'s initially because we thought it would be quick and cheap, but four failed attempts later Beth\'s burger bar appeared on the app! I think that was the Lord looking out for us. Our order consisted of chili cheese fries, Tenders platter, one burger and a turkey burger. Off bat let me say all of our fries were very salty. The chili cheese fries being the saltiest. While the fries were fried just how I like them- crackly and crisp but not dry- the overwhelming salt just gave my mother and I a little headache. It didn\'t help that when we noted for condiments (I.e honey mustard) and didn\'t receive it. However, salt and all the fries were eaten. Chicken tenders platter came in a large styrofoam plate with 4 decent sized tenders and a basket of fries to fill the box; for that price I loved it. It\'s definitely filling. (Get some sauces and sauces with it) The burger was enjoyed by another family member who asked "who made this? This is pretty good!" And being that they only eat burgers and chicken tenders from restaurants, the kid knows his stuff and that should be \'nuff said on how good the burger is. The turkey burger was good as well. My only nit pick was that it was a bit dry alone. I personally don\'t eat cheese or mayo, so therefore I didn\'t add it on. I believe if you just add a smidgent of any of the sauces the offer it\'ll take it next level. Overall, Beth\'s is the best place to order from at a UberEats perspective. Cost effective, generous portions and it\'ll leave you full n satisfied. Thanks Beth and gang! Be blessed! :)'],

                    "The atmosphere was great and the staff was really friendly and helpful. The only downside was the food was so mediocre. There was nothing bad, but there was nothing good either. The sweet potato fries were a little too dark and crispy and the whole time I was eating the burger I was waiting for it to get better. The patty itself was solid and the price point was good (get what you pay for?) plus they were open late. I'd technically give them a 3.5 just for this \xa0but def not a 4.I don't feel like I wasted my money, but I know I won't be back"],

                    "If your looking for a delicious but affordable burger, look no further! I stopped by Beth's Burger Bar today for lunch and was impressed with the quality of the food, and the value. I ordered a single burger with everything on it as well as the French fries. My meal was delivered promptly. The burger was actually really good! Definitely on par with some other local burger joints but I really enjoyed it. The fries were delicious too - perfectly crispy but soft in the middle. The best part was my burger, fries and a drink were under $10...which as we all know is a pretty good deal in our city!"],

My husband took on the burger challenge, and completed it with about 4 minutes remaining. We got his T-shirt and all. \xa0The food was VERY tasty. I had a triple black and bleu burger that was great! The staff is extremely friendly as well. We highly recommend Beth's burgers! Thank you for a great first night experience in Orlando.Quick update...we went back a second time while in Orlando, and it was just as good!

                    "The place: old school diner vibe, homey, and casual. Lots of TVs for sports. Clean bathrooms Service: very aware of the ingredients and preparation for all of the menu items. They try to accommodate allergies though butter is used on the grill and for many items (onions, eggs). Menu offers gluten free buns but they did not have them. Food: my partner had a burger over salad since there were no GF buns. I had a turkey burger with Swiss and avocado. It was delicious but don't waste the money on adding avocado- it was 4 of the tiniest slices I've ever seen, plus they were on the brink of being spoiled. This is a great stop for a quick bite, especially if you're craving a burger."],

Since we were in the area, and I wanted a burger, we had to visit again...especially after the great experience we had the last time we were here. \xa0Once again, we were greeted by friendly staff upon entering the restaurant. I ordered the build-your-own double burger with American cheese, then added the following free toppings: lettuce, tomato, onion, ketchup, mustard, and mayo. Instead of regular pickles, I added frickles (fried pickle chips) for $0.75. \xa0Folks, if you're pickle fans, get the frickles...you won't be sorry! You can get them on your burger or as a side item. \xa0In addition to the burger, I ordered a side of tater tots and a fountain soda. \xa0We didn't wait long for our food to be brought to our table. The food was as tasty as we remembered and EXACTLY what we wanted! After another positive experience, we are definitely fans for life and will be back! Keep up the great work!"],

                    "I was in the area and decided to check this place out after seeing great Yelp reviews. It was a Sunday afternoon so it was 4 other customers in the place. I was greeted immediately when I entered and given a brief tutorial on how to order. I choose a single patty, with pepper jack cheese, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, bacon, and ALL THE WAY (lettuce, tomorrow, onions, ketchup, mustard,and mayo). It tasted fresh and was good but I would have like my bacon cooked crispy like I ordered it and the mushrooms grilled a little longer. Another than that it was food! The bun was fresh and toasted on the inside. Yum! The fries were crispy and a Cajun flavor thick cut. I liked them. Overall I would stop by again It I saw one. I wanted to try the bottle sweet tea but didn't want to pay $5 for a bottle of sweet tea!!"],

They have a lot of various choices, the staff was very helpful and friendly, the décor was fun, the place was clean - but the burgers ( for the price you are paying) they were lacking toppings. My husband chose the peanut butter burger and the sauce didn't taste anything like peanut butter... I had a mac & cheese burger and I barely had mac & cheese in my burger - so we were very disappointed. However the fries were good. I wouldn't recommend this place if you want an amazing original burger- but if you aren't to picky and you want to support local Florida restaurants go ahead :)"],

I ordered a single burger, Monterey Jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle with a side of sweet potato fries. I will say the burger was pretty good. Tasted just right and hit the spot. The one thing I didn't like was the bun. It wasn't great and it honestly didn't seem fresh which kinda killed the entire burger. The sweet potato fries were great. Not too crunchy, not too soft, just right. Overall pretty happy. Would consider ordering again for sure if I'm in the area."],

                    'Sometimes, a girl just wants a good ol\' burger. \xa0This girl had a craving and went to Beth\'s Burger Bar off of Universal Blvd. \xa0This was actually my second visit, with the first one being in December of 2016. \xa0My first experience back then was okay but nothing to write home about. \xa0(Does anyone really write home anymore?) \xa0Soooo, I tried it again last night, 7/10/17 ... annnnnnnnd, it was the same as before. \xa0My burger was bland but the chili cheese fries were on point.I had built my own burger with a single patty, pickles, onion, bacon, cheddar cheese but no sauces. \xa0The bun was dry and nothing special, the beef patty was missing any "zing" and something was really "off" with the bacon. \xa0It just didn\'t taste fresh and I ended up taking it off. \xa0My friend had the same issue with the bacon on his breakfast burger. \xa0He also reported that his burger was "tasteless" ... (quoting his word.) \xa0So, maybe we ordered the wrong items and the sauce is the secret as it would have givien the beef and buns that something extra it needed? Maybe even extra sauce?We did like the chili cheese fries. \xa0(I remember liking the chili cheese tater tots on the last visit as well.) \xa0These are your basic french fries smothered in chili and something like cheese. \xa0Its not gourmet but that shouldn\'t stop you. \xa0Be bad. Be really bad. Throw you health out the window for a moment and just enjoy the cheap, cheesy sin.As for the staff, they were delightful. \xa0The restaurant was pretty clean, other than a few tables that weren\'t "bussed" ... we sat at one of them... nothing a napkin can\'t wipe off though.So, this girl didn\'t get that good ol\' burger she was craving. \xa0However, the chili cheese fries helped with the need to be fatty and bad. \xa0I gave this place a second "go" but I think I will be going to other burger joints around the area if I get the craving again.'],
